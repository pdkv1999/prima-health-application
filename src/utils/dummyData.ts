    referralBackground: `Thank you for referring Aarav (right-handed, 10 years, 11 months, currently in Class 4 at Vidya Mandir Bengaluru) for an ADHD assessment. The referral was initiated following concerns expressed both by Aarav’s parents and his class teacher about persistent difficulties with attention, organisation, and regulation of activity level. These difficulties have been observed across home and school environments for over two academic years.

An initial telephone intake was conducted on 09.04.25 with both parents present, followed by a clinical evaluation with Aarav and his mother on 07.05.25. A comprehensive cognitive assessment was completed by Dr. Raj Verma (Senior Educational Psychologist) on 12.05.25, with results reviewed jointly on 20.05.25. The assessment process included direct observation, structured interviews, behavioural questionnaires (Conners-4), and collateral input from school staff.`,
    medicalHistory: `Pregnancy & Birth: Aarav was born full-term via spontaneous vaginal delivery, weighing approximately 3 kg. There were no antenatal complications, and his mother reported no tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use during pregnancy. No postnatal complications were recorded.
Early Development: Milestones were achieved early — walked at 10 months, first words before 12 months, and short sentences by 18 months. There were no gross or fine motor coordination concerns. Toilet training was achieved within the expected timeframe, and no regression in skills has been noted.
Medical Conditions:
• Migraines: Onset around 3.5 years old, initially severe with vomiting, but markedly improved in the last two years. Managed under paediatric neurology review (Dr. Meera Nair).
• Iron deficiency: Documented in early childhood; requires ongoing supplementation.
• Allergies: No known drug allergies.
Medications:
• Ibuprofen PRN for headaches.
• Triptan PRN for migraines.`,

    other_difficulties: "Sleep onset difficulties are prominent, with Aarav typically taking 2–3 hours to fall asleep due to racing thoughts and inability to settle. Parents report he often gets up multiple times during the night, citing worries about school tasks or random thoughts. Bedtime routines are inconsistent due to his resistance to stopping preferred activities. Occasionally explosive reactions to perceived injustices, particularly when items are misplaced or when transitions are imposed without warning. These episodes can last 15-30 minutes and involve crying, shouting, and physical agitation. Hoards seemingly trivial objects including scraps of paper, old packaging, broken toys, and food wrappers, citing emotional 'memories' attached to them. Attempts to remove these items result in significant distress. Social difficulties include interrupting peers during conversations, difficulty reading social cues, and tendency to dominate group discussions with topics of special interest. Academic challenges extend beyond attention issues to include poor handwriting legibility, inconsistent mathematical computation despite good conceptual understanding, and extreme difficulty with written expression tasks. Fine motor skills appear adequate in isolation but deteriorate significantly when combined with cognitive demands.",
    comorbidities: "The hoarding behaviours may reflect an emerging obsessive-compulsive tendency, or may be related to executive function deficits including difficulty disengaging from ongoing activities and challenges with decision-making and categorisation. Given the family history of mental health conditions and the complexity of presentation, monitoring for developing anxiety disorders, mood dysregulation, and possible oppositional behaviours will be required. Sleep difficulties may represent a separate comorbid condition requiring specific intervention. The combination of ADHD symptoms with emerging obsessive-compulsive features suggests a complex neurodevelopmental profile that may benefit from multimodal intervention approaches. Consideration should be given to potential sensory processing differences given his reported need to manipulate objects and difficulty with certain textures and sounds in the environment.",
